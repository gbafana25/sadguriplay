# vid-player

Video/audio player for invidious instances. Made w/ Python and PyQt5

## TODO
- pause/play button should change text when toggled, if possible collapse w/ button that initially starts song
- delete `.mp4` files when song has downloaded
- volume controls
- duration/time indicator
- song search feature
    - search bar, show results, download as video/audio
- settings page
- toggle to show whole playlist versus songs downloaded
- fix: if another song is played before current is still running, they play at the same time
